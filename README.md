This repository contains scripts used to analyze data and generate figures for this publication.  
Data are deposited in Dryad at DOI: TBD  
Raw sequencing reads (SRA) and metagenomic assembled genomes (MAGs) are deposited in NCBI under Bioproject: PRJNA448579  

Most of the analysis was done in R using Rstudio. To reproduce the R analysis, 
1) Create an Rstudio Project folder
2) Clone the github Scripts folder into the Rstudio Project folder
3) Download the Dryad data and place the Data folder in the Rstudio Project folder
4) Then all filepaths in the scripts should find the correct files in the Data folder
